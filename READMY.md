# Programming Tasks, Advanced Robotics

This repository contains solutions to two programming challenges:

## 1. Carl's Spells

### Description
This Python program solves a problem related to checking if a string is magical or not. A string is considered magical if it can be constructed by inserting letters either at the beginning or the end of the string in a specific sequence.

### Usage
To run the program, run **carls_string.py**
You will be prompted to enter:
- `T`: The number of test cases.
- `N T-strings`: The strings to be checked, one per line.

The program will output whether each string is magical ("YES") or not ("NO").

## 2. Mirana and Arrows

### Description
This Python program tackles the problem of finding the maximum number of arrows that can be released by Mirana without exceeding a certain cumulative distance `K`.

### Usage
To run the program, run **mirana_and_arrows_program.py**
You will be prompted to enter:
- `N` and `K`: Where `N` is the number of arrows and `K` is the maximum cumulative distance.
- `N distances`: The distances that the arrows can travel, separated by spaces.

The program will output the maximum number of arrows Mirana can release without risking her life.
